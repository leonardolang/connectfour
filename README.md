# conn4

Implementation of Connect-Four game in Objective Caml using [Owl](https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl) library,
based on ideas from [this](https://github.com/tgoodlet/capnsmistress) implementation.

## Compiling and running

Owl can be installed via opam:

```
opam install owl
```

Compiling is done with `make`. The resulting **conn4** binary can be run to play the game.
